Login with credential validation
Investment screen (complete functionality needs to be implemented)

Python 3.x
tkinter library (install with pip install tkinter)
Instructions for use:

Save the code in a Python file (e.g., banco_invest.py).
Install the tkinter library if not already installed (pip install tkinter).
